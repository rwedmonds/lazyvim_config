## Installation

This is just [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) with [my changes](#my-changes) to suit my tastes and work with the [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) keyboard layout. Follow the installation instructions at lazyvim.org and, if Colemak is your chosen layout, use the keymaps [here](https://github.com/rwedmonds/lazyvim_config/blob/main/lua/config/keymaps.lua). 

## My Changes

### alpha.lua

Added **alpha.lua** for custom logo at home screen (pictured above)

### colorscheme.lua

Added **colorscheme.lua** to enable different themes

### disabled.lua

Added **disabled.lua** to disable the nvim-notify plugin because it makes NeoVim unusable

### keymaps.lua

This whole file is customized to work:

1. With the [Colemak](https://colemak.com) keyboard layout
2. With my preferences

### lazy.lua

Loaded plugins in the "extra modules section"

```sh
   -- import any extras modules here
    { "kdheepak/lazygit.nvim", dependencies = {
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
      } 
    },
    -- nvim-biscuits
    { "code-biscuits/nvim-biscuits" },
    {

      dependencies = { "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter" },
      config = function()
        require("render-markdown").setup({})
      end,
    },
    -- nvim-surround
    {

      version = "*", -- Use for stability; omit to use `main` branch for the latest features
      event = "VeryLazy",
      config = function()
        require("nvim-surround").setup()
      end,
    },

## A Few NeoVim Tips and Tricks

### Selection Tips

- Enter Visual Mode by typing `v` while in Normal Mode
- Enter Visual Block Mode with **CTRL**-`v`
- Reverse the direction of your selection while in Visual or Visual Block modes by typing `o`
- Generally, `i` will be used to insert text and `c` will be used to replace it

[Reverse Directions](./data/reverse_selection.gif)

### Block Insert

1. Put cursor where yoy want text (Text will appear to the right of cursor position)
2. **CTRL**-`v` to enter block select mode
3. Select block using movement keys
4. Type `:normal i<insertion text>`
5. Type text you want (It will appear only on first line)
6. Hit Esc (Text will appear on all other lines)

[Block Insert](https://github.com/rwedmonds/lazyvim_config/blob/main/data/block_insert.gif)

### Block Replacement

  1. Put cursor over first letter you want to replace
2. **CTRL**-`v` to enter block select mode
3. Select block using movement keys
4. `c` followed by text you want to replace with
5. **Esc** to exit and replace in entire selection

[Block Replacement](https://github.com/rwedmonds/lazyvim_config/blob/main/data/block_replacement.gif)

### Global Search and Replace

- Replace `foo` with `bar` across the entire file

  `:%s/foo/bar/g`

### Insert text at the beginning of lines

1. Use **CTRL**`v` to enter Visual Block Mode and select lines where you want to insert text
2. Type **SHIFT-`I` to enter Insert mode
3. Type the text you want to insert and hit **Esc**

### Append text to the end of lines

1. Use **CTRL**-`v` to enter Visual Block Mode and select the block of text you want to append
2. Type **SHIFT**-`A` to enter Append mode
3. Type the text you want to append ans hit **Esc**

### Using [ mini.surround ](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.surround)

Actions (all of them are dot-repeatable out of the box and respect `v:count` for searching surrounding) with configurable keymappings:

- Add surrounding with `sa` (in visual mode or on motion).
- Delete surrounding with `sd`.
- Replace surrounding with `sr`.
- Find surrounding with `sf` or `sF` (move cursor right or left).
- Highlight surrounding with `sh`.
- Change number of neighbor lines with `sn` (see |MiniSurround-algorithm|).

Surrounding is identified by a single character as both "input" (in `delete` and `replace` start, `find`, and `highlight`) and "output" (in `add` and `replace` end):

- f - function call (tring of alphanumeric symbols or '_' or '.' followed by balanced '()'). In "input" finds function call, in "output" prompts user to enter function name.
- 't' - tag. In "input" finds tag with same identifier, in "output" prompts user to enter tag name.
- All symbols in brackets '()', '[]', '{}', '<>". In "input' represents balanced brackets (open - with whitespace pad, close - without), in "output" - left and right parts of brackets.
- '?' - interactive. Prompts user to enter left and right parts.
- All other alphanumeric, punctuation, or space characters represent surrounding with identical left and right parts.

Configurable search methods to find not only covering but possibly next, previous, or nearest surrounding. See more in help for `MiniSurround.config`.

All actions involving finding surrounding (delete, replace, find, highlight) can be used with suffix that changes search method to find previous/last. See more in help for `MiniSurround.config`.
